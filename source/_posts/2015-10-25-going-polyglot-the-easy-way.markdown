I've just watched this presentation by Wojciech Ogrodowczyk about [Going Polyglot the Easy Way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWLnsrIpek8).

The slides used during the presentation can be found [here](https://speakerdeck.com/sharnik/going-polyglot-the-easy-way).

These are notes to myself taken while watching the presentation:

- It's better if you can use the language you are learning in your daily job than spending time om evenings and weekends.
- Look an opportunity to introduce the new language in your job.
- Use benchmarks to prove that the language fits the job.
- Do small changes: show results fast / throw away code
- Internal tool is a good place to start: issues will be reported / users will be forgiving
- Short-live code (i.e. migration code) is another good place to start.
- Do not mess around with mission critical systems
- Some places where introduce the new language:
  - Publish / Subscribe
  - SOA
- Learn something outside of your comfort zone: i.e. if you are used to backend learn a front end language (ELM, Clojurescript)
- ELM has "time travel" capabilities: you can record sessions & reply it later: debugging / triaging
- Fix vs Growth mindset
