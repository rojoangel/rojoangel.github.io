I've just read this post about [Optimizing the Sustainable Pace](https://blog.8thlight.com/paul-pagel/2015/09/15/optimize-sustainable-pace.html).

This are notes to myself.

> By doing the simplest thing that could possibly work, weâ€™re exposing ourselves to the incidental complexity

> The idea of sustainability assumes that resources are finite but cyclical. When you exhaust some amount of a resource, it can replenish itself only after a similar investment in its restoration.

The article refers to [Out of the Tar Pit - by Ben Moseley & Peter Marks](http://shaffner.us/cs/papers/tarpit.pdf)
