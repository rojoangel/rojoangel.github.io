I've just read this post about TDD best practices:  [What Not To Do In a TDD Pair Programming Interview - Software People Inspiring](http://codemanship.co.uk/parlezuml/blog/?postid=1324)

Although initially focused on pair programming interviews, the recommendations also apply to your day-to-day TDD flow.

Here's summary of DONT's:

- start by writing implementation code
- introduce speculative generality (create code we don't need to pass the tests)
- write weak or meaningless tests
- write redundant tests
- not running the tests
- not refactoring when it's obviously needed
- hack away at the code when 'refactoring'
- write one test that asks all the questions
