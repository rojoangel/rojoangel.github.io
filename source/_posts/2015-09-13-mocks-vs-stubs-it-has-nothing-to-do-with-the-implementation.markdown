I've just read this post about the difference between mocks and stubs: [Mocks vs. Stubs - It Has Nothing To Do With The Implementation](http://codemanship.co.uk/parlezuml/blog/?postid=1313)

According to the post:

> If we want our test to fail because external data suppled by a collaborator was used incorrectly, it's a stub.

> If we want our test to fail because a method was not invoked (correctly) on a collaborator, it's a mock.
