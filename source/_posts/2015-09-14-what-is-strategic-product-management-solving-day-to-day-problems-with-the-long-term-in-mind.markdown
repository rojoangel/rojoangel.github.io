I've just read this post about strategic product management: [What is Strategic Product Management? – solving day to day problems with the long term in mind](http://softwaredevelopmenttoday.com/2013/03/what-is-strategic-product-management-solving-day-to-day-problems-with-the-long-term-in-mind/)

These are notes to myself:

Sometimes is easy to lose sight on the long term direction:
> One team that I worked with at some point coined the phrase “being a slave to the backlog” to describe the feeling of powerlessness, and being imprisoned in the relentless rhythm that took them from story to story through overtime and much stress without a clear vision or direction.

We must always:

- begin with end in mind
- define the product vision
- regularly review those base on the feedback collected throughout development

Strategic product management focuses on:

- strategy
- portfolio
- roadmap
