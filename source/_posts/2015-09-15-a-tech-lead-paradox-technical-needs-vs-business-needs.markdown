I've just read this post [A tech lead paradox: technical needs vs business needs](https://www.thekua.com/atwork/2014/12/a-tech-lead-paradox-technical-needs-vs-business-needs/) about the conflict between business and technical needs:

> A business will always put pressure on a development team to produce as much software as possible. At the same time, effective delivery of software is not possible without addressing some level of technical needs â€“ such as technical debt, deployment pipelines, or automated test suites.

The article proposes the following practices to deal with the conflict:

- champion time for technical needs
- explain the business benefit of each technical need in order to build trust with non-technical people
- work on high impact items first
- keep a balance
- maximize the use of 'quiet' periods

The article refers to [Embracing Paradox - by Jim Highsmith](https://www.thoughtworks.com/de/insights/blog/embracing-paradox)
