I've just read these slides about dependency injection smells: [Slides for my 'Dependency Injection Smells' talk](http://php-and-symfony.matthiasnoback.nl/2013/06/slides-for-my-dependency-injection-smells-talk/)

These are notes to myself.

### Dependency injection smells:
- static dependency
- missing dependency auto-recovery
- hidden dependencies
- creation logic reduction
- factory methods
- programming against an implementation
- dependencies prohibited

### Keep in mind:
- be clear and open about your dependencies
- require only a minimum amount of dependencies
- develop with your users (other developers) in mind
