    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve just read this post about strategic product management: <a href="http://softwaredevelopmenttoday.com/2013/03/what-is-strategic-product-management-solving-day-to-day-problems-with-the-long-term-in-mind/">What is Strategic Product Management? – solving day to day problems with the long term in mind</a></p>

<p>These are notes to myself:</p>

<p>Sometimes is easy to lose sight on the long term direction:</p>

<blockquote><p>One team that I worked with at some point coined the phrase “being a slave to the backlog” to describe the feeling of powerlessness, and being imprisoned in the relentless rhythm that took them from story to story through overtime and much stress without a clear vision or direction.</p></blockquote>

<p>We must always:</p>

<ul>
<li>begin with end in mind</li>
<li>define the product vision</li>
<li>regularly review those base on the feedback collected throughout development</li>
</ul>


<p>Strategic product management focuses on:</p>

<ul>
<li>strategy</li>
<li>portfolio</li>
<li>roadmap</li>
</ul>
